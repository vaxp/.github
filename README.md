# üß† mususho // Systems Architect & Algorithms Expert

Welcome to my profile. I am a software and systems architect who believes that powerful software is built on a solid foundation of computer science and systems engineering. My work is focused on building high-performance tools and infrastructure, particularly for the Dart & Flutter ecosystem.

### üë®‚Äçüíª My Philosophy & Expertise

I bridge the gap between theoretical depth and practical application. My expertise isn't just a list of technologies; it's an integrated philosophy for building software:

* **Systems Architect:** Specializing in building and developing **Linux systems**, which gives me a deep understanding of performance and efficiency, right from the kernel level.
* **Algorithmist:** Mastery and application of **600+ algorithms and data structures**, enabling me to select the most effective solution for any given problem.
* **Polyglot Engineer:** I seamlessly navigate between high-performance systems languages like **C++** and **Rust**, and modern application languages like **Dart** and **PHP**.
* **Library & Tool Creator:** I build production-grade tools and libraries for the developer community, with a focus on clean, extensible, and well-documented code.
* **Flutter Expert:** I apply **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles** to architect robust and maintainable applications using the Flutter framework.

### üöÄ Current Focus & Contributions

My current focus is on pushing the boundaries of what's possible within the Dart ecosystem:

* üå± Expanding **[lunaris-engine](https://github.com/mususho/Lunaris-engine)**, the algorithms library I built to be the most powerful and comprehensive in the Dart ecosystem.
* üí° Strategically contributing to the **Dart language SDK itself**, with the goal of integrating core data structures and algorithms to improve the language for all developers.
* üèóÔ∏è Architecting complex applications with Flutter as a practical proof of the power and efficiency of the tools I develop.
